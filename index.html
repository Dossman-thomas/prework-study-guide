        <h2>HTML</h2>

          <br>

          <p>
            <u><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong></u> is made up
             of different elements (wrapped in angled brackets, &lt;" "&gt;
             &lt;/" "&gt;) that create the content and basic framework for 
             all webpages.
          </p>

          <br><br>

        <p>
          An <u>element</u> is the type of content on a webpage. Common examples 
          of elements include:
          <ul>
            <li>Text elements</li>
            <li>Image elements</li>
            <li>Header elements</li>
            <li>List elements</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Elements are also used to divide and describe content on a page. 
          Examples of such elements include:
          <ul>
            <li>Meta-related elements</li>
            <li>Content division elements</li>
            <li>Semantic elements</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          The two most important elements for the structure of the webpage are 
          the "head" and "body" elements.

        <br>

          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>head</strong> element contains information, 
              or <strong>metadata</strong> (unseen data about webpages that 
              the browser uses to serve the webpage to users) about the webpage 
              that is not visible to the user.</li>
            <li>The <strong>body</strong> element contains the content that 
              is visible to the user. All the content that we want the user to 
              see and interact with are put inside this element.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <div>
          <p class="notes">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> these two elements are examples 
            of <strong>semantic HTML elements</strong>, or elements that 
            describe their content and the role they play on the page. 
            It's important to use semantic elements whenever possible, because 
            they make your HTML easier to read for other developers and the 
            browser.
          </p>
        </div>


        <h3>The "head" element</h3>

        <p>
          The head element may contain the following elements:
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>'charset'</strong> element sets the character 
              encoding.
            </li>
            <li>the <strong>'http-equiv'</strong> element sets an HTTP header 
              for conent.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>'viewport'</strong> element sets the default view 
              for our webpage.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>'title'</strong> element defines the title of 
              the webpage and is the only visible element in the head element.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>The "body" element</h3>
        <p>
          The body element may contain other semantic elements including 
          the following:
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>'header'</strong> element appears at the top of the 
              page and usually contains a navigation menu, a title heading, 
              and/or other introductory content.
            </li>
            <li><strong>'heading'</strong> elements (e.g., h1, h2, h3, etc).
            </li>
            <li><strong>'section'</strong> elements that divide the contents of 
              the webpage into easier to read segments.
            </li>
            <li><strong>'paragraph'</strong> elements (p) that contain text.
            </li>
            <li><strong>'ul', 'ol',</strong> and <strong>'li'</strong> 
              elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list 
              items respectively.
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>'br'</strong> element creates a line break between 
              blocks of content.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>'a'</strong> element (stands for anchor) creates 
              links to the same webpage or other webpages you provide the URL 
              for using the <strong>'href'</strong> attribute
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>link</strong> element specifies relationships 
              between the current document and an external resource.  
              The <strong>'src'</strong> attribute defines the location of 
              the file.  The <strong>'alt'</strong> attribute contains a text 
              string that describes the appearance and functionality of the 
              image.  This is important for improving Search Engine 
              Optimization (<strong>SEO</strong>), screen readers, and 
              other assistive technologies.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>'footer'</strong> is last and appears at the bottom 
              of the page.  Usually, the footer element contains the 
              author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation of the 
              webpage.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p>
          <span>An important takeaway from this section is that we can use 
          semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well 
          as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</span>
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <div>
          <p class="notes">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> an attribute either modifies 
            the default functionality of an element type or provides 
            functionality to certain element types unable to function 
            correctly without them. Another example of important attributes are 
            the "class" and "id" attributes.  They help to name elements so they 
            can later be targeted and used with CSS and JavaScript.

        <h2>CSS</h2>

          <br>

          <p>
            <u><strong>Cascading StyleSheets (CSS)</strong></u> is a 
            programming language that determines how webpage content is presented 
            to users by defining colors, aesthetics, visual layouts, 
            and organization to specific elements of an HTML page. 
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Inline CSS</u> - used when the developer wants to style 
              an element directly in the HTML file. They're useful for quick 
              and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and 
              internal style sheets, because each style must be edited 
              individually whenever you make a design change. </li>
            <li><u>Internal CSS</u> - embeds an entire stylesheet directly in 
              the HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element.</li>
            <li><u>External CSS (most common)</u> - Preferred in most cases 
              because it allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a 
              seperate file, making design changes easier. When using an 
              external style sheet, we link the file using a "link" element 
              placed in the HTML's head section. Use &lt;link rel=”” href=””&gt; 
              to link a css file to your html file (rel attribute specifies 
              the relationship between the current and linked documents and 
              href specifies the location of the exernal resource.)</li>
          </ul>

          <br><br>

          <div>
            <p class="notes">
              <strong>NOTE:</strong> <u>Separation of concerns</u> 
              (a widely used term in web development) refers to separating code 
              into different files based on use and the idea that each section 
              of code should have its own responsibility.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br><br>

          <p>
            Selectors are used to define the element or attributes to which the 
            CSS rules, or declarations, will apply. We use the "class" attribute 
            as a selector to target certain elements on the page we'd like to 
            apply our CSS rules to. This helps us to prevent from repeating lines 
            of code for elements we want to style the same. 

          <br><br> 

          You can target more than one selector by seperating them with a comma 
          in CSS (e.g., .container, .text {};). 
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            <strong>Declarations</strong> contain two important components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The CSS property we want to apply</li>
            <li>The value of the property</li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          <div>
            <p class="notes">
              <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> the declaration {color: blue;} includes 
              the property "color" and the value of the property, "blue"
            </p>
          </div>

          <br>

          <p>
            <span>It's Important to note that every HTML element is essentially 
              a box. Each box consists of content that is contained by 
              padding, borders, and margin.  This is more commonly referred to 
              as the CSS box model and is extremely important to understand 
              while learning this language.</span>
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            There are several properties we can assign to HTML elements to 
            style them, including, but not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Padding</u> - adds space around the content <strong>inside</strong> an element.  Increasing the padding makes the entire element bigger!</li>
            <li><u>Border</u> - determines the size, style, and color of a line drawn around the element it's applied to. </li>
            <li><u>Margin</u> - adds space around the <strong>outside</strong> of an element.</li>
            <li><u>Width and Height</u> - defines the value of the width and the height of an element.  NOTE: these are seperate properties.</li>
            <li><u>Box-shadow</u> - adds shadow effects around an element's frame.  This allows you to describe the X and Y offsets relative to the element, the blur and spread radius, and the color of the shadow.</li>
            <li><u>Background-color</u> - defines the color of the background of an element.</li>
            <li><u>Color</u> - defines the text color of an element.</li>
            <li><u>Text-align</u> - allows you to define the alignment of the paragraphs in your webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>and many more!</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <br><br>

            <p>
              <span>all CSS properties and descriptions of them are easily 
                found online using Google!</span>
