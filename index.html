        <h2>HTML</h2>

          <br>

          <p>
            <u><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong></u> is made up
             of different elements (wrapped in angled brackets, &lt;" "&gt;
             &lt;/" "&gt;) that create the content and basic framework for 
             all webpages.
          </p>

          <br><br>

        <p>
          An <u>&lt;element&gt;</u> is the type of content on a webpage. Common examples 
          of elements include:

          <br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>Text elements</li>
            <li>Image elements</li>
            <li>Header elements</li>
            <li>List elements</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Elements are also used to divide and describe content on a page. 
          Examples of such elements include:

          <br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>Meta-related elements</li>
            <li>Content division elements</li>
            <li>Semantic elements</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          The two most important elements for the structure of the webpage are 
          the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements.

        <br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong> element contains information, 
              or <strong>metadata</strong> (unseen data about webpages that 
              the browser uses to serve the webpage to users) about the webpage 
              that is not visible to the user.</li>
            <li>The <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> element contains the content that 
              is visible to the user. All the content that we want the user to 
              see and interact with are put inside this element.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <div>
          <p class="notes">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> these two elements are examples 
            of <strong>semantic HTML elements</strong>, or elements that 
            describe their content and the role they play on the page. 
            It's important to use semantic elements whenever possible, because 
            they make your HTML easier to read for other developers and the 
            browser.
          </p>
        </div>


        <h3>The &lt;head&gt; element</h3>

        <p>
          The &lt;head&gt; element may contain the following elements:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>'charset'</strong> element sets the character 
              encoding.
            </li>
            <li>the <strong>'http-equiv'</strong> element sets an HTTP header 
              for content.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>'viewport'</strong> element sets the default view 
              for our webpage.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>'title'</strong> element defines the title of 
              the webpage and is the only visible element in the head element.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The &lt;body&gt; element</h3>
        <p>
          The &lt;body&gt; element may contain other semantic elements including 
          the following:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> element appears at the top of the 
              page and usually contains a navigation menu, a title heading, 
              and/or other introductory content.
            </li>
            <li><strong>'heading'</strong> elements (e.g., &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, etc).
            </li>
            <li><strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong> elements that divide the contents of 
              the webpage into easier to read segments.
            </li>
            <li><strong>'paragraph'</strong> elements (&lt;p&gt;) that contain text.
            </li>
            <li><strong>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;,</strong> and <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> 
              elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list 
              items respectively.
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>&lt;br&gt;</strong> element creates a line break between 
              blocks of content.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> element (stands for anchor) creates 
              links to the same webpage or other webpages you provide the URL 
              for using the <strong>'href'</strong> attribute
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>&lt;link&gt;</strong> element specifies relationships 
              between the current document and an external resource.  
              The <strong>'src'</strong> attribute defines the location of 
              the file.  The <strong>'alt'</strong> attribute contains a text 
              string that describes the appearance and functionality of the 
              image.  This is important for improving Search Engine 
              Optimization (<strong>SEO</strong>), screen readers, and 
              other assistive technologies.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> is last and appears at the bottom 
              of the page.  Usually, the footer element contains the 
              author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation of the 
              webpage.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p> 

        <br><br>

        <p>
          <span>An important takeaway from this section is that we can use 
          semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well 
          as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</span>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

          <br>
          <p>
            <u><strong>Cascading StyleSheets (CSS)</strong></u> is a 
            programming language that determines how webpage content is presented 
            to users by defining colors, aesthetics, visual layouts, 
            and organization to specific elements of an HTML page. 
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:
          </p>

          <br>

          <ol>
            <li><u>Inline CSS</u> - used when the developer wants to style 
              an element directly in the HTML file. They're useful for quick 
              and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and 
              internal style sheets, because each style must be edited 
              individually whenever you make a design change. </li>
            <li><u>Internal CSS</u> - embeds an entire stylesheet directly in 
              the HTML file using a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; element.</li>
            <li><u>External CSS (most common)</u> - Preferred in most cases 
              because it allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a 
              seperate file, making design changes easier. When using an 
              external style sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link&gt; element 
              placed in the HTML's head section. Use &lt;link rel=‚Äù‚Äù href=‚Äù‚Äù&gt; 
              to link a css file to your html file (rel attribute specifies 
              the relationship between the current and linked documents and 
              href specifies the location of the external resource.)</li>
          </ol>

          <br>

          <div>
            <p class="notes">
              <strong>NOTE:</strong> <u>Separation of concerns</u> 
              (a widely used term in web development) refers to separating code 
              into different files based on use and the idea that each section 
              of code should have its own responsibility.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong><u>Selectors</u></strong> - Are used to define the element or attributes to which the CSS rules, or declarations, will apply. We use the "class" attribute as a selector to target certain elements on the page we'd like to apply our CSS rules to. This helps us to prevent from repeating lines of code for elements we want to style the same. 

          <br><br> 

          You can target more than one selector by seperating them with a comma 
          in CSS:
          <br><br>

            <div class="commands">
              .container,
              <br>
              .text,
              <br>
              .button {
              <br><br>
              //block of code;
              <br><br>
              }
            </div>
        
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Declarations</strong> contain two important components:
            <br><br>
              <ol>
                <li>The CSS property we want to apply</li>
                <li>The value of the property</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

          <br>

          <div>
            <p class="notes">
              <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> the declaration {color: blue;} includes 
              the property "color" and the value of the property, "blue"
            </p>
          </div>

          <br>

          <p>
            <span>It's Important to note that every HTML element is essentially 
              a box. Each box consists of content that is contained by 
              padding, borders, and margin.  This is more commonly referred to 
              as the CSS box model and is extremely important to understand 
              while learning this language.</span>
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            There are several properties we can assign to HTML elements to 
            style them, including, but not limited to:
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Padding</u> - adds space around the content <strong>inside</strong> an element.  Increasing the padding makes the entire element bigger!</li>
            <li><u>Border</u> - determines the size, style, and color of a line drawn around the element it's applied to. </li>
            <li><u>Margin</u> - adds space around the <strong>outside</strong> of an element.</li>
            <li><u>Width and Height</u> - defines the value of the width and the height of an element.  NOTE: these are seperate properties.</li>
            <li><u>Box-shadow</u> - adds shadow effects around an element's frame.  This allows you to describe the X and Y offsets relative to the element, the blur and spread radius, and the color of the shadow.</li>
            <li><u>Background-color</u> - defines the color of the background of an element.</li>
            <li><u>Color</u> - defines the text color of an element.</li>
            <li><u>Text-align</u> - allows you to define the alignment of the paragraphs in your webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>and many more!</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <br><br>

            <p>
              <span>all CSS properties and descriptions of them are easily 
                found online using Google!</span>

            <u>Create a Branch</u> 
            Create a branch in your repository. A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance.

            <br><br>

            <div class="commands">
              git checkout -b &lt;new branch name&gt;

            <ul>
              <li>the "git" command must precede each Git statement.</li>
            
              <li>the "checkout" command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
              <li>It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <u>Make Changes</u> On your branch, make any desired changes to the repository. Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push additional changes to fix the mistake.
          </li>

          <li>
            <u>Commit and Push</u> Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes it contains. Ideally, each commit contains a complete change. 
            <br><br>
            By committing and pushing changes, your work is backed up to remote storage allowing you to access your work from any device! It also allows your collaborators to view your work, respond to questions, and make contributions.
          
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                add changed files in your working directory to the staging area of Git:

              <div class="commands">
                git add -A

              <br>

              <li>
                Now that all of our changes have been staged, we can commit to our repository and add a simple message associated with the commit:
              </li> 
             
             <div class="commands">
               git commit -m 'add message here'

            <li>
              Next, let's make sure our current branch is up to date before opening a pull request. It is good habit to pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code:
            </li>

            <div class="commands">
              git pull origin main
            </div>
            
            <br>

            <li>
              Push up all of your changes using the following command:
            </li>

            <div class="commands">
              git push origin "branch name"
            </div>
            
            <br>
          
          </ul>

          <li>
            <u>Create a Pull Request</u> - Ask for feedback on your changes. In addition to filling out the body of the pull request, you can add comments to specific lines of the pull request to explicitly point something out to reviewers.  
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Address Review Comments</u> - Reviewers can comment on the whole pull request or add comments to specific lines or files. You can continue to commit and push changes in response to the reviews and you pull request will update automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Merge Your Pull Request</u> - Once your pull request is approved, you may merge your pull request. This will automatically merge your branch to the default/master/main branch. GitHub will retain the history of comments and commits in the pull request to help future collaborators understand your changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Delete Your Branch</u> - After merging your pull request, delete the branch. This indicates that branch's work is complete and prevents anyone from accidentally working on old branches.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <p>
          <strong><u>Javascript (js)</u></strong> - an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that allows users interactivity with websites and applications.
          
          <br><br>

          In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes static HTML/CSS webpages and makes them interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is working!
        </p>

        <br>

        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> with experience, JavaScipt creates games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more! 
          </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Much like CSS files, you can organize Javascript files seperate from the HTML.  Use the src=" " attribute in your script element to link js files.

            <div class="commands">
              &lt;script src="assets/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </div>
          </li>

        
          <li>
            <strong><u>Control Flow</u></strong> - The order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        
        <p>
          <span><strong>ORDER COUNTS!</strong></span>
        </p>

        <br>

            
        <h3>Assigning a Variable</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong><u>Variables</u></strong> - Assignable containers that store different data types. To assign a variable, begin by typing 'let' if the variable will change,'const' if it will stay the same, or 'var', followed by a name of your chosing.  When naming variables, it's important to note that Javascript is case-sensitive! This means the names 'myVariable' and 'myvariable' are not the same.
          <br><br>
          After declaring a variable, give it a value by equating (=) it to a data type.
          for example:
          <br><br>
        
            <div class="commands">            
            let myVariable = 5;
          </div>
              
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> it's common practice to use camel case when naming in JavaScipt. 
            <br><br>
            To give a couple examples - instead of 'myvariable' and 'mysecondvariable', use 'myVariable' and 'mySecondVariable' as your variable names.    
          </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <h3>Features and Data Types</h3>

        <ol>

          <li>

            <u>String</u> - a sequence of characters and the most commonly used data type to store text.  Signified by '&lt;string of text&gt;' or "&lt;string of text&gt;"

          </li>

          <li>
            
            <u>Number</u> - Numbers don't need ' ' or " " marks. Typing numbers directly into code works.
          
          </li> 

          <li>
            
            <u>Boolean</u> - Used to store the values true and false in a database.  They're most commonly used in databased to represent yes/no, on/off, or other related states. Boolean values have one of two possible values - Truthy (true) and Falsy (false) values.
          
          </li>

          <li>
            <u>Undefined</u> - A variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. 
          </li>

          <li>
            <u>Null</u> - Represents the intentional absence of any object value. The number variable is then empty at the moment but may change value later.
          </li>

          <li>
            <u>Object</u> - This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.
          </li>

        </ol>


        <h3>Using Conditional Logic</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>          
              <strong><u>Conditionals</u></strong> - Code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>If Statements</u> - a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the "if" statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.

            <br><br>

            <u>Creating an "if" Statement:</u>


            <div class="commands">            
              if (condition){
                <br>
              // block of code to be executed if condition is truthy
                <br>
              }
            </div>

            When the computer encounters an "if" statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do the action we ask it to do between the curly brackets. If the condition isn't true or has a value that isn't truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.  Using conditional statements such as "if" statements allows us to interrupt control flow. 
          </li>

          <li>

              <u>"else if" and "else" Statements</u> - Provides an if statement with more than one condition.  
              <br><br>
              Here are a couple examples: 

            <div class="commands">            
              if (condition){
                <br><br>
              // block of code to be executed if condition is truthy
                <br><br>
              } else if (condition){
                <br><br>
              // block of code to be executed if first condition is falsy and this condition is truthy
                <br><br>
              } else {
                <br><br>
              // block of code to be executed if none of the conditions are truthy
                <br><br>
              }
            </div>

            <div class="commands">
              let dinner = "tacos";
                <br><br>
              if (dinner === "tacos"){
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;alert("Yay, I lOVE TACOS!");
                <br><br>
              } else {
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;alert("Awww, but tacos are my favorite...");
                <br><br>
              }
            </div>

          </li>

          <div class="notes">
            <p>
              <strong>NOTE:</strong> we use '===', the strict equality operator, to check to see if two values are equal, and return a Boolean result, true, if the values are equal, and false, if the values are not equal.
            </p>
          </div>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using Arrays and Loops</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong><u>Arrays</u></strong> - A single variable used to hold a group of data that is typically related in some way.  To create an array, declare a variable like we have before, but instead of assigning the variable to a single value, assign it to a group of values between square brackets [].
            <br><br>

            <div class="commands">
              let myArray = ['apple','cherry','banana'];
            </div>

            <br>

            To work with individual data items inside an array, we need the location of the data item in the array. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array. 
            <br><br>
            In JavaScipt, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.  This means that the first item in myArray above, 'apple', has an index of 0.  Because the indices are sequential (increasing by 1), 'cherry' then has an index of 1, and 'banana' 2. 
            <br><br>
            As an example, we can log 'banana' in our console with the following code:
            <br><br>
            <div class="commands">
              let myArray = ['apple','cherry','banana'];
              <br><br>
              console.log(myArray[2]);
            </div> 

            <br><br>
            <div class="notes">
              <p>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong><u>The for Loop</u></strong> Uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a block of code to be executed over and over. 
            <br><br>
            A for loop contains the following three important statements, in order:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Determine the starting point of our loop.</strong> Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set the condition.</strong> As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. Written out:
                <div class="commands">
                  x &lt; myArray.length;
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Indicate the iteration</strong> Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1
              </li>
            </ol>

            Therefore, to write for loops, your code should look like this:

            <div class="commands">
              for(let x = 0; x &lt; myArray.length; x++){
                <br><br>
                // code block to execute;
                <br><br>
              }
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Writing and Calling Functions</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong><u>Functions</u></strong> - A powerful core component of many programming languages ‚Äî not just JavaScript ‚Äî that allows developers to reuse code to perform certain tasks. It's important to remember that functions don't automatically run when the page is loaded. In order for them to work, you must call them within the code. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><u>Write a function</u></strong> - Begin by typing 'function', a function name, parentheses (to define parameters), and squiggly brackets {to encapsulate blocks of code}.  Remember that even if we don't define parameters, it's important to always include the parentheses. 
            <br><br>
            Here's an example of a function to log the string, "Hello, world!" in the console:

            <div class="commands">
              function helloWorld ( ) {
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Hello, world!")
                <br><br>
              }
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><u>Calling the function</u></strong> - Now, just because the function above was created, doesn't mean it'll run the code inside. In order to use the code in the function, we must call it by typing the function name, parentheses, and semi-colon. 
            

            <div class="commands">
              helloWorld ( );
            </div>

            <br>

            <span>Don't forget: since control flow dictates that Javascript files are executed from top to bottom, where you call your functions matters!</span>

          </li>
        </ul>
